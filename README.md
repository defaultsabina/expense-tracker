# Expense Tracker ðŸ’°

### Task ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ¯


An amazing Expense tracker app using React.js ðŸš€

#### Mandatory tasks:
1. My app has 3 component: 
  - ***Your Balance*** - which will display *total balance*, *incomes* and *expenses*.
  - ***History*** - which will display List of your *incomes* and *expenses*.
  - ***Transaction*** - form where you can add a new transaction.
2. If the transaction amount is less than zero, then the expense increase. If the transaction amount is greater than zero, then the income increases. Note: **Updating Total balance** as well!
3. When you hover over any transaction, a **delete** button should appear. By clicking this button, you can delete any transaction.
